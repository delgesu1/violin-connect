# Repertoire Migration Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating from direct title/composer properties to using masterPieceId references in the Violin Connect application. The migration aims to improve data normalization, consistency, and maintainability.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `RepertoireContext` for centralized access to piece data
- ✅ Implemented utility functions for accessing piece information (`getPieceTitle`, `getPieceComposer`, etc.)
- ✅ Added runtime warnings for deprecated property usage
- ✅ Created migration utilities for converting pieces to use masterPieceId

### Components Updated
- ✅ Created `PieceDisplay` component for standardized piece display
- ✅ Updated `LessonHistory` component to use `PieceDisplay`
- ✅ Updated `RepertoireDisplay` component to use `PieceDisplay`
- ✅ Updated `PieceDetailDialog` in Repertoire.tsx to use `PieceDisplay` while preserving original layout
- ✅ Created `PieceDisplayAdapter` to bridge between `RepertoireItemData` and `PieceDisplay`
- ✅ Fixed type issues in Index.tsx to support both `RepertoirePiece` and `LegacyRepertoirePiece`

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed React Hooks Order violation in PieceDetailDialog by ensuring hooks are called before any conditional returns
- ✅ Fixed hook usage in non-component functions by passing context utilities as parameters
- ✅ Fixed ReferenceError by moving function definitions before their usage
- ✅ Restored original layout for PieceDetailDialog while using new components

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive migration guide in `REPERTOIRE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Added JSDoc comments for deprecated properties
- ✅ Created this migration progress report

## Remaining Tasks

### Component Updates
- ❌ Update remaining components that directly access title/composer properties:
  - Student.tsx
  - StudentDetail.tsx
  - RepertoireItem.tsx
  - Any other components using direct property access

### Type Refinement
- ❌ Refine type definitions to better handle the transition period
- ❌ Create more robust adapter patterns for different data structures

### Testing
- ❌ Test all components with both legacy and new data structures
- ❌ Verify that migrations run correctly on application startup
- ❌ Create automated tests for migration utilities

### Final Cleanup
- ❌ Remove deprecated properties when all components are updated
- ❌ Remove adapter components when no longer needed
- ❌ Update documentation to reflect final state

## Known Issues
- Console warnings about "Using deprecated direct title/composer property" indicate components still using the old pattern
- React Fragment warning in Dashboard component (Index.tsx) - may be related to a development tool
- Some components may need additional type adapters for full compatibility
- ✅ ~React Hooks order violation in PieceDetailDialog~ (Fixed)
- ✅ ~ReferenceError in Repertoire.tsx~ (Fixed)
- ✅ ~PieceDetailDialog layout issues~ (Fixed)

## Next Steps
1. Continue updating remaining components to use context utilities
2. Address any console warnings about deprecated property usage
3. Test thoroughly across the application
4. Remove deprecated properties when all components are updated

## Conclusion
The migration is well underway with core infrastructure in place and several key components updated. The remaining work focuses on updating additional components and finalizing the migration by removing deprecated properties.
