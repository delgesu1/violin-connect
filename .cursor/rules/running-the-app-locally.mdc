For future launches, follow these exact steps:
First, start Supabase locally using npx:
   npx supabase start

Then start the Vite development server:
   npm run dev

Avoid attempting global installations of Supabase CLI and always use npx to leverage your project's local dependencies. If we need to run any database migrations or commands, I'll use:
npx supabase [command]

This approach ensures proper compatibility with your project setup and avoids permission issues with global installations.
